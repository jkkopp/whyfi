# Agent instructions for whyfi

Read this before making changes. `MEMORY.md` (same directory) has the *why*
behind non-obvious decisions — check it before reintroducing something that
looks missing; it may have been deliberately removed.

## Layout

- `backend/` — Django + DRF + Postgres. Apps: `sensors` (device identity/auth
  tokens), `scans` (all passive radio observations), `distribution` (APK
  hosting/versioning).
- `frontend/` — React + Vite PWA. Built as a Docker build stage and copied
  into the backend image; not run as its own container in production.
- `android/` — Kotlin/Compose native app. Built headlessly via
  `android/Dockerfile` (Gradle + Android SDK cmdline-tools). No Android
  Studio or emulator in this repo's toolchain.
- `mockloc/` — dev-only standalone Android app (Java) for emulator testing.
  Spoofs GPS via a test location provider and models a directional RSSI
  antenna pattern exposed over a local HTTP server, so the scanner can be
  exercised without a physical device. Not part of the main build,
  docker-compose, or the APK distribution — build and install it on demand
  (see `mockloc/README.md`). The `ACCESS_MOCK_LOCATION` permission lives in
  `app/src/debug/AndroidManifest.xml` (AGP rejects it in main) — keep it
  there. mockloc cannot inject synthetic WiFi scan results (no Android API
  for that); it only computes RSSI and exposes it via HTTP. Wiring that
  into whyfi's scan path is a separate task.
- `docs/` — architecture, API reference, deployment, Android setup, roadmap.

## Commands

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up                              # postgres + backend + android-builder (single port, no nginx/Caddy)
docker compose exec backend python manage.py test
docker compose exec backend python manage.py migrate
docker compose exec backend python manage.py import_apk <path> --version-code=N --version-name=X  # only for externally-built APKs
```

The normal way to build the Android app is the PWA's Download page →
**Build Android App** button (`POST /android-build/trigger/`,
`GET /android-build/status/`) — `android-builder` runs always-on as a
watcher, not a one-shot `docker compose run`. See `docs/android-setup.md`
and `distribution/services.py`'s module docstring.

Frontend is built as part of `backend/Dockerfile`; there is no standalone
`npm run dev` server checked in as the primary workflow — if you add one for
local iteration, keep the production path as "build into the backend image."

## Conventions

- **Naming**: every radio-type table is `<Radio>Observation` —
  `WiFiObservation`, `CellObservation`, `BLEObservation`,
  `SatelliteObservation`, `LANObservation` — all FK'd to a single
  `ScanSession` (one physical scan pass, or one standalone LAN sweep).
  Follow this pattern for any new radio type; don't invent a parallel
  session/event concept.
- **Ingest is one endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/scan-sessions/` takes optional
  per-radio observation arrays in one payload, keyed by
  `client_scan_id` for idempotent retries. Don't add separate per-radio
  ingest endpoints — that breaks the atomicity/idempotency the single
  endpoint gives you for free. The atomicity is *not* free-standing though:
  it's `@transaction.atomic` on `ScanSessionIngestSerializer.create` (there's
  no `ATOMIC_REQUESTS`), and it has to stay, because idempotency is what makes
  a partial write permanent rather than self-healing — the device's retry
  matches the existing session, gets a 201 and drops the payload.
- **Caller-supplied row counts go through `positive_int()`** (`scans/views.py`)
  — `session_limit`, `limit`, `resolve-addresses`' limit. They all end up as
  queryset slice bounds, and a negative slice is an unhandled `ValueError`
  → 500. Don't reintroduce a bare `int(request.query_params.get(...))`.
- **The coverage/heatmap endpoints return a `capped_response()` envelope**
  (`{results, truncated, observation_limit}`), not a bare array, because they
  group observations in Python under a fixed cap. Keep the flag and keep
  surfacing it in the UI — silently truncating a map is indistinguishable
  from an empty area. See MEMORY.md.
- **Auth is two independent layers**: (1) the Android app authenticates
  ingest with a per-`Sensor` token, admin-managed; (2) every read endpoint
  (and the PWA itself) requires a logged-in Django session — the same
  superuser account as `/admin/`, no separate account system. Don't add a
  real multi-user system without checking with the maintainer first; do keep
  using `IsAuthenticated` + `SessionAuthentication` as the default for any
  new read endpoint (that's the project-wide `REST_FRAMEWORK` default in
  `config/settings.py`, so new viewsets get this for free unless you
  override it). See `docs/api.md` and `MEMORY.md`.
- **Serving**: Django (gunicorn + WhiteNoise for static, MEDIA for APKs) is
  the only container that serves HTTP. Do not add an nginx or Caddy
  container — see `MEMORY.md`.
- **Android scanning runs in `scan/ScanForegroundService`, not a
  Composable-scoped coroutine.** `ScanScreen`/`LanScreen` bind to it and
  observe its `StateFlow<ScanUiState>`; the service itself is independently
  *started* (`ScanForegroundService.start()`) so it survives tab switches
  and the app being backgrounded. Any new scan action (a new radio type, a
  new sweep mode) should go through this service, not a fresh
  `rememberCoroutineScope()` — that's exactly the bug this replaced (see
  MEMORY.md).
  **Bind to it once, in `WhyfiApp`, and pass the handle down** — never per
  screen. The service `stopSelf()`s when idle, and a stopped service is
  destroyed the instant its last client unbinds, so per-screen bindings leave
  a zero-client gap on every tab switch that silently wipes `ScanUiState`.
- **The phone keeps the last two scan passes in memory and nothing more.**
  `ScanUiState.latestPass`/`previousPass` back the results tables, and
  `SurveyTally` accumulates unique devices (not passes) for the Dashboard.
  Both live in the scan service and are meant to die with it — the totals say
  "this session" precisely because of that. Don't "fix" this by adding a Room
  history table: the outbox is deliberately write-then-delete and the full
  survey belongs on the backend. See `docs/architecture.md`.
- **The LAN sweep picks its subnet from `NetworkInterface`, not
  `ConnectivityManager.activeNetwork`.** With a VPN up, `activeNetwork` is the
  tunnel and its first IPv4 address is a `/32` — which the scanner reported as
  "no other addresses on it" while the phone sat on a populated `/24`. Keep
  `unavailableReason()` distinct from an empty result: empty must mean "swept,
  nobody answered", and a sweep that can't run must not upload a session.
  `LanScannerTest` pins the classification. See `docs/architecture.md`.
- **Adaptive scan cadence is driven by platform sensors, never Play
  Services.** `motion/MotionDetector.kt` degrades through three tiers and
  needs no runtime permission; don't "improve" it with
  `ActivityRecognitionClient` (adds Play Services) or `TYPE_STEP_COUNTER`
  (adds `ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION`). The judgement lives in the pure
  `MotionClassifier`, which is unit-tested — put new rules there, not in the
  detector. The three intervals live on `SensorScanPolicy` so the app and
  `/remote` stay consistent; the device reports its motion state so a slow
  cadence never looks like a hang. See `docs/architecture.md`.
- **`android/…/scan/RadioFormat.kt` mirrors `backend/scans/serializers.py`**
  (`band_for_frequency`, `channel_for_frequency`,
  `security_type_from_capabilities`). Change one side and you must change the
  other, or the phone and the PWA report different channels and security for
  the same sighting. `RadioFormatTest` is pinned to the same cases as
  `SecurityParsingTests`; `gradle testDebugUnitTest` runs them in the
  `android-builder` container.
- **Control-plane state is desired/reported reconciliation, not a command
  queue.** Remote scanning control (`SensorScanPolicy`) stores what a device
  *should* be doing; the device polls `POST /sensors/me/heartbeat/`, reports
  what it *is* doing, and converges. Any future "tell a device to do X"
  feature should follow this rather than queueing commands: it's idempotent,
  survives offline periods with no replay of stale instructions, and makes
  "stop then start again" just two writes where the last wins. The
  `policy_revision`/`reported_policy_revision` pair is what lets the UI tell
  *pending* from *applied*; keep echoing it. Note the backend can never push
  to a phone — see MEMORY.md for why FCM isn't the fix.
  **The device's poll cadence is part of that contract**: while armed but not
  scanning it backs off to `min(heartbeat_interval * 4, 60s)`
  (`RemoteControlAgent.IDLE_BACKOFF`/`IDLE_MAX_MS`), and
  `SensorScanPolicy.agent_online` judges staleness against *that*, through the
  mirrored constants in `sensors/models.py`. Change one side and you have to
  change the other, or a perfectly healthy device reads as offline. See
  MEMORY.md.
- **Theme is System/Light/Dark on both clients, implemented independently
  per stack.** PWA: `frontend/src/theme.ts` + `data-theme` attribute + CSS
  variables in `index.css`. Android: `ui/theme/Theme.kt`'s `WhyfiTheme` +
  `ThemePreference` in `SettingsRepository`. Same teal accent on both. If
  you change one palette, check the other still matches.
- **Sensor field richness**: capture whatever the platform API actually
  exposes for a radio type (see `WiFiObservation`/`CellObservation`/
  `BLEObservation`/`SatelliteObservation`'s extra fields) rather than only
  the minimum needed for the current UI — but every such field must be
  nullable/blank with a sensible default, since older Android versions or
  absent hardware won't populate it. Adding a field means touching the
  model, the ingest input serializer, the read serializer (`ModelSerializer`
  with `fields = [...]` needs the new field added explicitly; `"__all__"`
  ones pick it up automatically), the `create()` logic, and the matching
  Android DTO — see any of the `*ObservationInputSerializer`s for the
  pattern.
- **Verify Android changes by building an APK through the Build button, not
  by compiling a mounted copy.** `android-builder` bind-mounts
  `./android:/workspace` (docker-compose) so it sees current source — but the
  image also bakes a copy via `COPY . .`, so if that mount is ever removed the
  watcher silently compiles stale code and still reports `SUCCESS`. That
  already shipped an APK missing an entire feature. To actually confirm new
  code is in the artifact, grep the dex:
  `unzip -o <build>.apk 'classes*.dex' && grep -a <NewClassName> classes*.dex`.
  See MEMORY.md.
- **Generate migrations against a real Postgres, then copy the file to the
  host immediately.** `backend/` is not bind-mounted into the `backend`
  container, so `docker compose exec backend python manage.py
  makemigrations` writes the file into that container's ephemeral
  filesystem only — `docker cp` it into `backend/scans/migrations/` (or the
  relevant app) right away, or it silently disappears the next time the
  container is recreated even though the database itself already has the
  change. See MEMORY.md — this has already happened once.

## Things not to reintroduce

- No anti-stalking/tracker-alert correlation logic (`SuspectedTracker`,
  sighting-clustering, "mark as mine"/dismiss workflows). BLE detection is a
  plain passive observation log like every other radio type — nothing more.
  This was explicitly scoped out; see `MEMORY.md`.
- No offensive capability (deauth, injection, monitor-mode capture) in this
  codebase. That's an explicit v-next, external-hardware-sensor track, not
  something to add to the Android app directly.
- No internal reverse-proxy container (nginx/Caddy). The maintainer fronts
  this with their own Nginx Proxy Manager instance; the backend just needs to
  expose one plain port.
- No Docker socket access for the backend (or any other container). The
  "Build Android App" button works via a shared-volume file-signal protocol
  between `backend` and the always-on `android-builder` watcher instead
  (`distribution/services.py` + `android/docker-build.sh`) — don't reach for
  `docker.sock`/`docker-py`/`subprocess`-calling-the-Docker-CLI to "simplify"
  this; that's host-root-equivalent access from an internet-reachable
  container. See `MEMORY.md`.
- No NFC feature. It existed (foreground dispatch, `NfcObservation`), then
  was removed entirely at the maintainer's request — no dedicated screen
  ever existed for it, only tap-while-app-happens-to-be-open, and rather
  than build it a proper UI the call was to cut it. Don't re-add without an
  explicit new ask.
